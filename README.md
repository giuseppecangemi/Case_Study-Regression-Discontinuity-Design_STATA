# Case_Study-Regression-Discontinuity-Design_STATA
In 1947, the compulsory school-leaving age in England, Scotland and Wales was raised from 14 to 15 years old. Within two years after policy implementation, the proportion of individuals who left full-time education by age 14 fell to less than 10 percent. I investigate whether this government policy has had any effect on the monetary rate of return. In order to get useful information I developed different models.  First, I develop the ordinary least squares method (OLS), then the instrumental variable method (IV) and finally I show a regression discontinuity design (RDD).

OLS: To estimate more familiar and comparable returns to years of schooling, we measure education by the age at which individuals completed full-time education.
