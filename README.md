# Case_Study-Regression-Discontinuity-Design_STATA
In 1947, the compulsory school-leaving age in England, Scotland and Wales was raised from 14 to 15 years old. Within two years after policy implementation, the proportion of individuals who left full-time education by age 14 fell to less than 10 percent. I investigate whether this government policy has had any effect on the monetary rate of return. In order to get useful information I developed different models.  First, I develop the ordinary least squares method (OLS), then the instrumental variable and finally I will develop a regression discontinuity design.
